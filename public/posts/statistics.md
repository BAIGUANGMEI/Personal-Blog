## Statistics

I hope to be a data analyst in the future. Statistics is basic of data analysis.So, I am currently learning statistics. Writing this blog to record my learning process.

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics is a method to describe and summarize the data. It includes measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), table and charts.

### Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency are used to describe the center or typical value of a dataset. The most common measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.

Mean:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

Median:
$$
\mathrm{Median} = 
\begin{cases} 
x_{\frac{n+1}{2}} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
\frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
\end{cases}
$$

Mode:
$$
\mathrm{Mode} = 
\begin{cases} 
x_i & \text{if } x_i \text{ appears most frequently} \\
\text{No mode} & \text{if all values appear equally}
\end{cases}
$$

### Measures of Dispersion

Measures of dispersion are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. The most common measures of dispersion are range, variance, and standard deviation.

Range:
$$
\mathrm{Range} = \max(x_i) - \min(x_i)
$$

Standard Deviation:
$$
\mathrm{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

Variance:
$$
\mathrm{Variance} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

Interquartile Range (IQR):
$$
\mathrm{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

Quartiles:
$$
Q_1 = \text{Median of the lower half of the data} \\
Q_3 = \text{Median of the upper half of the data}
$$

### Table and Charts

In statistics, table includes the frequency table and contingency table.

Chart includes the histogram, bar chart, line chart, and pie chart and so on.

## Inferential Statistics

### 6 Steps of Inferential Statistics:
1. Hypothesis
2. Population and Sample
3. Hypothesis Testing
4. Find the critical value or p-value.
5. Significance
6. Errors

### Errors

There are two types of errors in inferential statistics: type I error and type II error.

|  | True | False|
|------|-------|-------|
| Accepted | Correct | Type II Error |
| Rejected | Type I Error | Correct |

Type I Error: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
Type II Error: Accepting the null hypothesis when it is false.
